The device I will be describing for this assignment is my crockpot a.k.a. slow cooker.
I use my crockpot to cook delicious food for my family and I.  My crockpot is basically a ceramic bowl that sits inside
a heating element.  Uncooked ingredients are placed inside the bowl and covered with a lid.  The heating element accepts 
data in the form of on or off inputs.  The on input consist of different length of time selections.  The shorter the length
of time selected the hotter the heating element is set which cooks the food quicker.  Once the user selects the time length
desired for their meal the heating element outputs heat which heats the ceramic bowl which heats the food.  The result is 
a delicious meal that is cooked over a selected period of time.
